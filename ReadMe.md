# Secure Properties GUI
## A TornadoFx application for encrypt/decrypt of Mule 4 properties
### Mule 4 provides a jar file and instructions for encrypting and decrypting properties. Some environments would benefit from a GUI for DevOps teams or other staff to perform these functions.

In my blog post [Securing Mule 4 config properties](https://bestow.info/securing-mule-4-config-properties) I discuss how you would go about securing your YAML and .property files. One of the requirements is to downloading a Mule Jar file and manually encoding or decoding secrets. Manual processes can be error prone or inappropriate for support teams to use.

This package has been installed in the git repository as an Uber Jar. If you choose to download it instead of building it your self, be sure to run it in the same folder as the Mule 4 secure properties jar.
